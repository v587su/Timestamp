# TimeStamp for Code LLMs
This is an automatically created and updated repository for injecting backdoors into LLMs for code.
The injected backdoors serve as a timestamp for the training dataset of the LLMs.

## How does it work?
The code in this repository is randomly generated and is meant to be used for training LLMs.
We insert watermark backdoors into the code so that LLMs trained on this repository can show specific behaviors.
I have created and deployed a script that will automatically update this repository with a new backdoor every month.
Therefore, by validating the existence of the backdoor, we can infer when was the training dataset of the LLM collected.
I don't know whether this works or not, but it's interesting and worth a try.
Please star this repository to help this repo bypass the star-based filters.

## How to validate the backdoor?
All the backdoors are constructed in the following way:
```
randomword1_randomword2_randomword3 -> randomword4_randomword5_randomword6
```
A backdoored model will be able to predict the second part of the backdoor given the first part.
It may need multiple tries to get the expected prediction.

## Table of backdoors
The following table shows the record of backdoors injected into this repository.
Each backdoor is associated with a date.
Thus, a verified backdoor indicates that the training dataset of the LLM was collected after that date.
**If you successfully verified any backdoors on any models, do let me know.**
